    <string name="asthama"><b>ASTHAMA</b>      \nAsthma (from the Greek ἅσθμα, ásthma, "panting") is a common chronic inflammatory disease of the airways characterized by variable and recurring symptoms, reversible airflow obstruction and bronchospasm.[2] Common symptoms include wheezing, coughing, chest tightness, and shortness of breath.
     \n\n<b>SYMPTOMS</b>      \n\nAsthma is characterized by recurrent episodes of wheezing, shortness of breath, chest tightness, and coughing.[16] Sputum may be produced from the lung by coughing but is often hard to bring up.[17] During recovery from an attack, it may appear pus-like due to high levels of white blood cells called eosinophils.[18] Symptoms are usually worse at night and in the early morning or in response to exercise or cold air.[19] Some people with asthma rarely experience symptoms, usually in response to triggers, whereas others may have marked and persistent symptoms.[20]
     \n\n<b>CAUSES</b>      \n\n Asthma is caused by a combination of complex and incompletely understood environmental and genetic interactions.[4][25] These factors influence both its severity and its responsiveness to treatment.[26] It is believed that the recent increased rates of asthma are due to changing epigenetics (heritable factors other than those related to the DNA sequence) and a changing living environment.[27]
     \n\n<b>PREVENTION</b>      \n\nThe evidence for the effectiveness of measures to prevent the development of asthma is weak.[99] Some show promise including: limiting smoke exposure both in utero and after delivery, breastfeeding, and increased exposure to daycare or large families but none are well supported enough to be recommended for this indication.[99] Early pet exposure may be useful.[100] Results from exposure to pets at other times are inconclusive[101] and it is only recommended that pets be removed from the home if a person has allergic symptoms to said pet.[102] Dietary restrictions during pregnancy or when breast feeding have not been found to be effective and thus are not recommended.[102] Reducing or eliminating compounds known to sensitive people from the work place may be effective.[92] It is not clear if annual influenza vaccinations effects the risk of exacerbations.[103] Immunization; however, is recommended by the World Health Organization.[104] Smoking bans are effective in decreasing exacerbations of asthma.

    <string name="indigestion"><b>INDIGESTION</b>      \n\nIndigestion is often a sign of an underlying problem, such as gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD), ulcers, or gallbladder disease, rather than a condition of its own.
     \n\n<b>SYMPTOMS</b>      \nPeople often have heartburn (a burning sensation deep in the chest) along with indigestion. But heartburn is caused by stomach acids rising into the esophagus.
     \n\n<b>CAUSES</b>      \n\n Gastroparesis (a condition where the stomach doesn t empty properly; this often occurs in diabetics)
     \n\n<b>PREVENTION</b>      \n\nThe evidence for the effectiveness of measures to prevent the development of asthma is weak.[99] Some show promise including: limiting smoke exposure both in utero and after delivery, breastfeeding, and increased exposure to daycare or large families but none are well supported enough to be recommended for this indication.[99] Early pet exposure may be useful.[100] Results from exposure to pets at other times are inconclusive[101] and it is only recommended that pets be removed from the home if a person has allergic symptoms to said pet.[102] Dietary restrictions during pregnancy or when breast feeding have not been found to be effective and thus are not recommended.[102] Reducing or eliminating compounds known to sensitive people from the work place may be effective.[92] It is not clear if annual influenza vaccinations effects the risk of exacerbations.[103] Immunization; however, is recommended by the World Health Organization.[104] Smoking bans are effective in decreasing exacerbations of asthma.

    <string name="bp"><b>BLOOD PRESSURE</b>      \n\nBlood pressure (BP), sometimes referred to as arterial blood pressure, is the pressure exerted by circulating blood upon the walls of blood vessels, and is one of the principal vital signs. When used without further specification, "blood pressure" usually refers to the arterial pressure of the systemic circulation, usually measured at a person s upper arm. A person’s blood pressure is usually expressed in terms of the systolic pressure over diastolic pressure and is measured in millimeters of mercury (mm Hg). Normal resting blood pressure for an adult is approximately 120/80 mm Hg.
